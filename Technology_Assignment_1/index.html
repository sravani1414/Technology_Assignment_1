                    Rumpelstiltskin or Rumplestiltskin is the antagonist of a fairy tale that originated in Germany.Once there was a miller who was poor, but who had a beautiful daughter.Because of her special feature she became queen and gave birth to a child.As he promised one person she had to return her child to him but she can't.the queen was when she heard the name. And when soon afterwards the little man came in, and asked, "Now, mistress queen, what is my name?"

                    At first she said, "Is your name Conrad?"

                    "No."

                    "Is your name Harry?"

                    "No."

                    "Perhaps your name is Rumpelstiltskin?"

                    "The devil has told you that! The devil has told you that," cried the little man, and in his anger he plunged his right foot so deep into the earth that his whole leg went in, and then in rage he pulled at his left leg so hard with both hands that he tore himself in two.

                <h6>
                    Once upon a time there were three billy goats, who were to go up to the hillside to make themselves fat, and the name of all three was "Gruff."

                    On the way up was a bridge over a cascading stream they had to cross; and under the bridge lived a great ugly troll , with eyes as big as saucers, and a nose as long as a poker.

                    So first of all came the youngest Billy Goat Gruff to cross the bridge.

                    "Oh, no! pray don't take me. I'm too little, that I am," said the billy goat. "Wait a bit till the second Billy Goat Gruff comes. He's much bigger."

                    "Well, be off with you," said the troll.

                    A little while after came the second Billy Goat Gruff to cross the bridge.

                    Trip, trap, trip, trap, trip, trap, went the bridge.

                    "Who's that tripping over my bridge?" roared the troll.

                    "Oh, it's the second Billy Goat Gruff , and I'm going up to the hillside to make myself fat," said the billy goat, who hadn't such a small voice.

                    "Now I'm coming to gobble you up," said the troll.

                    "Oh, no! Don't take me. Wait a little till the big Billy Goat Gruff comes. He's much bigger."

                    "Very well! Be off with you," said the troll.

                    But just then up came the big Billy Goat Gruff .

                    Trip, trap, trip, trap, trip, trap! went the bridge, for the billy goat was so heavy that the bridge creaked and groaned under him.

                    "Who's that tramping over my bridge?" roared the troll.

                    "It's I! The big Billy Goat Gruff ," said the billy goat, who had an ugly hoarse voice of his own.

                    "Now I 'm coming to gobble you up," roared the troll.

                    Well, come along! I've got two spears,
                    And I'll poke your eyeballs out at your ears;
                    I've got besides two curling-stones,
                    And I'll crush you to bits, body and bones.

                    That was what the big billy goat said. And then he flew at the troll, and poked his eyes out with his horns, and crushed him to bits, body and bones, and tossed him out into the cascade, and after that he went up to the hillside. There the billy goats got so fat they were scarcely able to walk home again. And if the fat hasn't fallen off them, why, they're still fat; and so,

                    Snip, snap, snout.
                    This tale's told out.

                    There was once a shoemaker, who worked very hard and was very honest: but still he could not earn enough to live upon; and at last all he had in the world was gone, save just leather enough to make one pair of shoes.Remaining is unable to explain.So lets see conclusion.The good couple saw them no more; but everything went well with them from that time forward, as long as they lived.

                    The sly Devil has many names.He is the prince of underworld,but he wanders the earth tempting humans.A wonderful and ancient story tells of DR. Faust selling his soul to mephistopheles in return for the promise of a lifetime of youthfulness and ceaseless pleasure - which lasts untill the devil finally reappears to collect the old dedt.The day of reckoning is always terrible and teahes us not to be tempted.

                    people make the mistake of leaving Jack-o-Lanterns outside,ignored and untended,after Hallowen.They don't like such neglect.So the moment the sunsets they come to the windows.They glow as though their candle were still aflare.They want you!Don't pull down your hat.And don't hide under the blanket or behind the door.Jack-O-Lanterns are very sly;they know every trick.Only One thing satisfies them.hearing you scream.Or Knowing you love them and will go with them and make someone else scream.
