And when soon afterwards the little man came in, and asked, "Now, mistress queen, what is my name?"

                    At first she said, "Is your name Conrad?"

                    "No."

                    "Is your name Harry?"

                    "No."

                    "Perhaps your name is Rumpelstiltskin?"

                    "The devil has told you that! The devil has told you that," cried the little man, and in his anger he plunged his right foot so deep into the earth that his whole leg went in, and then in rage he pulled at his left leg so hard with both hands that he tore himself in two.

                <h6>
                    Once upon a time there were three billy goats, who were to go up to the hillside to make themselves fat, and the name of all three was "Gruff."

                    On the way up was a bridge over a cascading stream they had to cross; and under the bridge lived a great ugly troll , with eyes as big as saucers, and a nose as long as a poker.

                    So first of all came the youngest Billy Goat Gruff to cross the bridge.

                    "Oh, no! pray don't take me. I'm too little, that I am," said the billy goat. "Wait a bit till the second Billy Goat Gruff comes. He's much bigger."

                    "Well, be off with you," said the troll.

                    A little while after came the second Billy Goat Gruff to cross the bridge.

                    Trip, trap, trip, trap, trip, trap, went the bridge.

                    "Who's that tripping over my bridge?" roared the troll.

                    "Oh, it's the second Billy Goat Gruff , and I'm going up to the hillside to make myself fat," said the billy goat, who hadn't such a small voice.

                    "Now I'm coming to gobble you up," said the troll.

                    "Oh, no! Don't take me. Wait a little till the big Billy Goat Gruff comes. He's much bigger."

                    "Very well! Be off with you," said the troll.

                    But just then up came the big Billy Goat Gruff .

                    Trip, trap, trip, trap, trip, trap! went the bridge, for the billy goat was so heavy that the bridge creaked and groaned under him.

                    "Who's that tramping over my bridge?" roared the troll.

                    "It's I! The big Billy Goat Gruff ," said the billy goat, who had an ugly hoarse voice of his own.

                    "Now I 'm coming to gobble you up," roared the troll.

                    Well, come along! I've got two spears,
                    And I'll poke your eyeballs out at your ears;
                    I've got besides two curling-stones,
                    And I'll crush you to bits, body and bones.

                    That was what the big billy goat said. And then he flew at the troll, and poked his eyes out with his horns, and crushed him to bits, body and bones, and tossed him out into the cascade, and after that he went up to the hillside. There the billy goats got so fat they were scarcely able to walk home again. And if the fat hasn't fallen off them, why, they're still fat; and so,

                    Snip, snap, snout.
                    This tale's told out.

                    There was once a shoemaker, who worked very hard and was very honest: but still he could not earn enough to live upon; and at last all he had in the world was gone, save just leather enough to make one pair of shoes.Remaining is unable to explain.So lets see conclusion.The good couple saw them no more; but everything went well with them from that time forward, as long as they lived.

                    The sly Devil has many names.He is the prince of underworld,but he wanders the earth tempting humans.A wonderful and ancient story tells of DR. Faust selling his soul to mephistopheles in return for the promise of a lifetime of youthfulness and ceaseless pleasure - which lasts untill the devil finally reappears to collect the old dedt.The day of reckoning is always terrible and teahes us not to be tempted.

                    A gnome  is a diminutive spirit in Renaissance magic and alchemy, first introduced by Paracelsus in the 16th century and later adopted by more recent authors including those of modern fantasy literature. Its characteristics have been reinterpreted to suit the needs of various story tellers, but it is typically said to be a small, humanoid creature that lives underground.

                    Sometimes there are people who feel that nobody cares about them.They want people to love them but nobody does.On the outside they look ugly and witchlike.They are witches,but they are good,and you never know it.They make you see your watch when you have lost it.They put another cookie in the bag when you thought it was empty.They get you home safely on dark nights and do other good deeds.But no one knows of these good thngs.No one loves them,and they are very,very Sad.

                    An angel is a supernatural being or spirit found in various religions and mythologies. In Abrahamic religions and Zoroastrianism, angels are often depicted as benevolent celestial beings who act as intermediaries between god or Heaven and Earth, or as guardian spirits or a guiding influence.Other roles of angels include protecting and guiding human beings, and carrying out God's tasks.The term "angel" has also been expanded to various notions of spirits found in many other religious traditions. The theological study of angels is known as "angelology".

                    Ouija boards... demons... possession... Satanism.... The words themselves strike fear in the hearts of many people - especially those with strong religious beliefs. Danielle is one of those people, yet in the span of a month, the curiosity of her youth drew her away from her church to what her faith would call the dark side. And the results, according to her sworn testimony below, would be devastating and terrifying.

                    Non-believers would say that Danielle's experience was strictly psychological in nature, a product of her deep-seated religious belief system. Believers, however, assert that everything she went through - and is going through - is all too real: that demons really are out there, waiting to possess the innocent.

                    Whether it is real or not is in some respects irrelevant. Danielle believes it to be real, and so its effects on her life are real. This is Danielle's story....

                    This took place in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada at Springs Church. It all started around March, 2011 when I took up an interest in demonology. It didn't take long until the study had converted me from a Christian to a full-out Satanist. I had started attempting to summon demons and I never got a sign there was one there, so I bought a Ouija board.

                    On April 8, I used it to see if my promised Guardian Demon was there, and I remember the whole thing word for word, and here's how it went:

                    Me: Is there anyone else in this room with me who wishes to speak with me?

                    Ouija: YES.

                    Me: Holy - ! Are you good or bad?

                    Ouija: B.

                    Me: Ok.... Will you do anything to harm me or anyone?

                    Ouija: MAYBE.

                    Me: Alright then, how many spirits are here?

                    Ouija: 3.

                    Me: Okay, what are your names?

                    Ouija: BELIAL MALPHAS LEGION.

                    I thought perhaps it was just my imagination, so I decided to quit. Right as I was about to leave, I heard loud hissing from all around me...

                    “Somebody who is performing procedures that children don’t need, pulling teeth that he knows should still be in the child’s mouth. In some cases, we even have where many procedures were done, except what they came in for,” Sarris said.

                    Sarris said he represents Dominic and dozens of Schneider’s former patients. This month, he filed the potential class action suit against Schneider on behalf of these children, claiming “patterns of abuse of his child patients” – an accusation that has been made before.
